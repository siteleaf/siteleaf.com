Siteleaf aims to be transparent and honest. A smart, lightweight, considered platform for creating and maintaining websites. Focus on your content instead of your management system.

We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to host your website anywhere you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. That our tools should be simplified, not dumbed down.
