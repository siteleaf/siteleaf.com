We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to host your website wherever you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS and never be locked into a vendor.

Our tools should be simple, but never dumbed down.

Static sites are faster, more secure, and keep visitors happy. According to Google, nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile site if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds. Unlike legacy CMSs like WordPress and Drupal, your website’s source code and content should be free and accessible. Never be locked into a particular service again. 

In recent years, static websites have surged in popularity. But along with that has come a lot of bloat. Let’s keep static sites how they were intended: fast and simple.

Free your content and enjoy building websites again.

An open web is a better web.
