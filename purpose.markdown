We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to access your data and host your website however you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS and never be locked into a vendor.

Our tools should be simple, but never dumbed down.

Static sites are faster, more secure, and keep visitors happy. Unlike legacy CMSs like WordPress and Drupal, your website’s source code and content should be accessible and easily moved. An open web is a better web.

In recent years, static website generators have surged in popularity. But along with that has come a lot of bloat (and new acronyms). Let’s keep static sites how they were intended: fast and simple.

Free your content and enjoy launching your next site.
