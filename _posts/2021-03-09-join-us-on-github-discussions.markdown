The [Siteleaf Community](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions) now has a new home on GitHub Discussions where you can get help, vote on new features, and share what you're working on!

To get started we have topics for:

* ‚ùì [Community Support](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/community-support): Ask the community for help with Jekyll and Siteleaf.

* üí° [Feature Requests](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/feature-requests): Vote and share ideas for new features.

* üôå [Show & Tell](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/show-tell): Show off something you've made.

* üí¨ [General Discussion](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/general-discussion): Everything else.

GitHub Discussions will replace our existing Slack community, and we look forward to a more accessible, organized, and searchable archive for questions that pop up often.

We also hope to offer a greater level of transparency by opening up our roadmap and allowing the community to [vote on new features](https://github.com/siteleaf/community/discussions/categories/feature-requests).
