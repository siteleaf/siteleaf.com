We always love hearing the experiences of others who have built their site with Siteleaf. [Jessica Harllee](http://jessicaharllee.com/), Siteleaf Hackday MVP and all around cool person, was nice enough to write about how she used Siteleaf to rebuild [Erin Nolan's personal site](http://www.madebyeno.com/). Some great takeaways from her post include how she used Siteleaf [metadata](/blog/metadata-in-siteleaf/) fields on posts and assets to achieve a unique color palette for each page and to control how images were displayed throughout the layout. 

> On the blog, some posts are more text-heavy whereas sometimes Erin wants a glorious image header. To make it flexible, we look for an asset with the [meta field] `type` of `hero` and display that image above the post excerpt. If there’s no hero image, then the post text displays as normal.
