Today we are officially launching our much requested affiliate program: [Siteleaf VIP](https://vip.siteleaf.com/signup)

We know a lot of our customers use Siteleaf with clients (and enjoy referring friends and colleagues), so we’re excited to say thanks and give back!

For every new user who signs up with your unique VIP link, you’ll earn a 30% commission for any paid sites they create. Depending on the [plan](/plans) chosen, you could earn over $1,000/year for a single referral — which recurs for as long as the site is active. For freelancers, this is a nice way to add a little recurring revenue to your income.

### How it works

[Sign up](https://vip.siteleaf.com/signup) to create a unique referral link, and share this with your clients and colleagues. Feel free to add this link to your website footer and share it on social media. It looks something like this:

```
https://www.siteleaf.com/?via=yourname
```

You can link to any page on siteleaf.com by adding `?via=yourname` to the end of the URL.
