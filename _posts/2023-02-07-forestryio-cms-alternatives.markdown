Forestry.io, a fellow static site CMS, has announced it will be shutting down on April 21, 2023 (see [Forestry.io's End of Life announcement](https://forestry.io/blog/forestry.io-end-of-life/)).

While its definitely a pain for website owners and developers who support these sites, we welcome Forestry.io to migrate their static websites to Siteleaf for free (and we're here to help!). Siteleaf is a content management system with many of the same features, so we think you'll feel at home here.

Siteleaf has been trusted for over 10 years by companies like Microsoft, Kickstarter, Museum of Modern Art, and New York University. We are [purpose-driven](https://www.siteleaf.com/purpose/) and here for the long haul.
