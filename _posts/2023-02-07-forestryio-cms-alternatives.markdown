Forestry.io, a fellow static site CMS, has announced it will be shutting down on April 21, 2023 (see [Forestry.io's End of Life announcement](https://forestry.io/blog/forestry.io-end-of-life/)).

While this news is definitely a pain for website owners and developers who support these sites, we welcome those looking for a Forestry.io replacement to migrate their static websites to Siteleaf for free (and we're here to help!). Siteleaf is a content management system with many of the same features, so we think you'll feel at home here.

#### Why migrate to Siteleaf CMS?

Siteleaf has been trusted for over 10 years by companies like Microsoft, Kickstarter, Museum of Modern Art, and New York University. We are [purpose-driven](https://www.siteleaf.com/purpose/) and here for the long haul.

Siteleaf has tight integration with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which hosts over a millions websites built with Jekyll. You can also publish static websites to Amazon S3 (or any hosting of your choice), automate tasks with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/zapbook/siteleaf/), and access a fully-featured [API](https://learn.siteleaf.com/api/).

#### How do I move my site from Forestry.io to Siteleaf?

For websites built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), you can [import your site](https://manage.siteleaf.com/sites/new) from GitHub with just a couple clicks. We have a free plan for open source developers, as well as affordable plans for personal and businesses ([see our plans](/plans/)).

For complex sites or other static site generators (Next.js, Hugo, Gatsby, Eleventy, etc), our Enterprise team is happy to provide our white glove migration service ([get in touch](mailto:enterprise@siteleaf.com?subject=Enterprise%20migration)).
