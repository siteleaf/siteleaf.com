      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <p><p>By using the Siteleaf.com web site (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;), or any services of Oak Studios LLC (&ldquo;Siteleaf&rdquo;), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (&ldquo;Terms of Service&rdquo;). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates and all users who access our services through your account to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo; shall refer to such entity, its affiliates and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this agreement and may not use the services.  </p>

<p>Siteleaf reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <a href="http://siteleaf.com/terms">siteleaf.com/terms</a></p>

<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While Siteleaf prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that Siteleaf cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>

<h4>A. Account Terms</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.</p></li>

<li><p>You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.</p></li>
<li><p>Your login may only be used by one person—a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.</p></li>
<li><p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Siteleaf cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p></li>
<li><p>You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</p></li>
<li><p>One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>B. API Terms</h4>

<p>Customers may access their Siteleaf account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Siteleaf, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You expressly understand and agree that Siteleaf shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Siteleaf has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</p></li>
<li><p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Siteleaf via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. Siteleaf, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Siteleaf will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.</p></li>
<li><p>Siteleaf reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p></li>

After this period, there will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. </p></li>
<li><p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new prorated amount on your next billing cycle.</p></li>

<li><p>To permanently terminate your account, email <a href="mailto:team@siteleaf.com">team@siteleaf.com</a>. All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon termination. This information can not be recovered once your account is terminated.</p></li>
<li><p>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up period, your benefits will remain active for the entire time that you purchased and you will not be charged again. Should you wish to terminate your account before the end of your current paid up period, your termination will take effect immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Siteleaf, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other Siteleaf service, for any reason at any time.
